## PSStackedView - put your ViewControllers in a stack, inspired by Twitter's iPAD UI.

After reviewing other stacked implementations, i wrote my own solutions from scratch.
This one lets you add plain UIViewControllers to a PSStackedViewRootViewController, working much like a UINavigationController.
All the hard parts, moving, shadows, rounded borders is taken care of.

## Roadmap
- Add (conditional) support for the new child view controller system in iOS5
- much more stuff
